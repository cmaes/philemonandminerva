<p>Philemon and Minerva Morriss crossed the Oregon Trail in 1852, leaving Iowa in April and settling in Sublimity, Marion County, Oregon in September. Philemon kept a diary of the trail detailing miles made, sites seen, and other details. This diary has generated significant interest in the couple and their history, especially among descedents, many of whom still live in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>The couple met and married in Sangamon County, Illinois in April 1845 after Philemon lost his first wife, Nancy Jackson, early that year. Philemon had four living children from his first marriage:
<ul>
<li>Julia Ann, born 1833 in New Salem, IL, child of Philemon and Nancy Jackson
<li>Survigny, born 1835 in New Salem, IL, child of Philemon and Nancy Jackson
<li>Elizabeth, born 1838 in New Salem, IL, child of Philemon and Nancy Jackson
<li>Douglas, born 1843 in New Salem, IL, child of Philemon and Nancy Jackson.
<li>Philemon and Nancy had a number of other children -- Lucy Ann (twin to Julia Ann) and Thomas
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Philemon and Minerva stayed in Illinois for a few years. During this time, Philemon fought in the Mexican American War and Minerva gave birth to Philemon Delacy and Amanda, the couple's first children. The family soon moved to Polk County, Iowa. There, they had Annis, named for Minerva's mother and sister, before leaving on the trail in 1852:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philemon Delacy, born 1846 in New Salem, IL, child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
<li>Amanda, born 1848 in New Salem, IL, child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
<li>Annis, born 1850 in Polk County, IA child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
</li>
</ul>
<p>Philemon and Minerva had four more children once they got to Oregon:
  <ul>
<li>Albert, born in 1853 in Sublimity, Oregon, child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
<li>Narcissa, born 1855 in Sublimity, Oregon, child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
<li>Cordelia, born 185_ in Sublimity, Oregon, child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
<li>Edwin, born 185_ in Sublimity, Oregon, child of Philemon and Minerva Pierce
  
</li>

</ul>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

						Philemon Delacy Morriss was born December 5, 1807, in Christian County, Kentucky. He married his first wife, Nancy, on January 31, 1827, in Sangamon County, Illinois. In 1831, they moved to New Salem in Menard County, Illinois, where Philemon opened a tannery and befriended a promising lad by the name of Abraham Lincoln. Family lore has it that Philemon and Abe split fence rails together in Illinois, and it is known that Lincoln lived with the Morriss family for a time.<br>
						<br>
						Philemon and Nancy had five children together before her death. Minerva Pierce became Philemon's second wife on April 16, 1845. Records indicate that Philemon served in the Mexican War in 1846, mustering out in New Orleans on May 26, 1847, after eleven months as a private in Company F of the Fourth Illinois Regiment.<br>
						<br>
						In 1849, the Morriss family moved to Polk County, Iowa, and in 1852 they emigrated to the Oregon Territory. They settled in the Santiam River valley, which was opened to settlers by treaty with the Santiam tribe on May 7, 1851.</font><font face="New York,MS Serif,Palatino,Times New Roman"><br>

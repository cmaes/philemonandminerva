Diary of Philemon Delacy Morriss, Sr. (1807-1883)

"Sold out my land in Ioway on Monday the 19 day of March 1852 and know
for Orrgon," wrote Philemon D. Morriss, Sr. (diary page 3).

Just 50 years earlier, Meriwether Lewis [1] was said to be travelling
"..in country totally unknown...on a river he had never heard of that
went he know not where." The Morriss family, though by no means the
first to journey West, still embraced that early pioneer spirit. What
courage! What an adventure! And what a heritage!!

Philemon D. Morriss' life was full. While working in a small
settlement in Illinois he met and befriended a young Abraham
Lincoln. While married to Nancy Jackson he fathered 7
children. Following her passing, he married Minerva Pierce and
fathered another 9 children. And at 44 years of age, he set out for
Oregon. The focus here is on that trek to Oregon, revealed in a diary
he kept. His diary was transcribed and typed some years ago and it
appears at least some copies of that transcript have been circulated.

Now 150 years later, I was given access to the original document
complete with Philemon's thoughs, observations, his phonetic spelling
and, yes, even his doodling. With great care and some minor risk to
the document, I scanned (EPSON Perfection 1240U), stored (Dell
Dimension, Pentium III, model 220-5392) and copied the diary on
compact discs (CD's) so that is contents may be shared easily and
preserved indefinitely.

Physical characteristics of the diary:
--------------------------------------
Width: approximately 6 1/8 inches.
Height: approximately 7 5/8 inches.
Depth: approximately 1/2 inch.
Number of Pages: 92 (excluding the front and back covers and the
missing pages identified below).

While worn, the diary is still very readable with few exceptions. The
diary's overall good condition has to be due, in part, to the fact
that it has been kept in a safe deposit box out of the light and
protected from damaging and handling. The front and back covers are
particularly worn, as are the first and last few pages. Additionally,
there are stubs of some missing pages that appear to have been cut out
with a sharp instrument. The missing pages are at these locations:

* Following the front inside cover, 14 pages are gone (28 counting
  front & back),
* Following page 76 (a blank page), 5 pages (10 front & back),
* Following page 84, 4 pages (8 front & back), and
* Following page 90, 1 page (2 front & back).

If you received only this introduction, you can contact me at the
location below for CD's containing the full diary. If you already have
the CD's, read, enjoy, and share in the fascination.
